                                        <p><b>Eddie is shaped like an oval</b>, or “omega”, so that it actually fits the penis
                                            for a comfortable experience. Cock rings are shaped like a circle. We don’t know
                                            why, the penis isn’t a circle. This means cock rings clench the penis all around,
                                            causing pain and discomfort.</p>
                                        <p><b>Eddie comes with two different tension bands</b>, the blue "Comfort" band and

                                        <p><b>Eddie constricts the veins, but not the arteries or urethra.</b> This means better
                                            blood flow, and more open, natural-feeling ejaculation. Cock rings constrict

                                        <p>Place Eddie at the base of your penis, in front of your testicles, with the opening

                                        <p>Wrap one of the tension bands around the ends of the device. Use the blue band for
                                            less constriction, or use the red band for maximum constriction.</p>
                                        <p>For those with limited hand strength, an alternative method is to wrap the tension
                                            band around Eddie before placing it on your penis, then gently pull Eddie apart to
                                            create a wider opening, while sliding it down onto the base of your penis. You can

                                        <p>The Stay-Giddy Plan is our subscription option for Eddie. Sign up and automatically receive fresh Eddies and tension bands every 4 months. Your payment information on file will be charged the appropriate amount, and your Eddie and bands will be shipped for free in 3-5 business days.</p>

                                            <li>Keeps your Eddie and bands clean, safe, and pleasing to yourself and your
                                                partner.</li>
                                            <li>Over time, with use, Eddie and the bands will stretch and lose tension.
                                                Replacing them regularly will maintain an optimal fit, feel, and results.</li>
                                            <li>You can have extra Eddies and tension bands ready to go, and conveniently stored
                                                in various locations.</li>
                                            <li>Replacing your Eddie and bands is recommended if you change sexual partners or

                                        <p>When purchasing an Eddie 1-Pack or 2-Pack, during checkout you may have the option to
                                            add additional Eddies at a lower cost. It’s a great way to add an extra “backup”
                                            Eddie to your order without paying full price. Any extra Eddies you add will also
                                            come with 6 tension bands (3 of each strength). Please note: If you add an Eddie to
                                            a 1-pack, you’ll receive a 2-pack. If you add an Eddie to a 2-pack, you’ll receive a
                                            2-pack plus a separate 1-pack.</p>

        "text": "how do you wear eddie? eddie can be applied when your penis is flaccid (soft) or erect (hard). place eddie at the base of your penis, in front of your testicles, with the opening facing down. wrap one of the tension bands around the ends of the device. use the blue band for less constriction, or use the orange band for maximum constriction. for those with limited hand strength, an alternative method is to wrap the tension band around eddie before placing it on your penis, then gently pull eddie apart to create a wider opening, while sliding it down onto the base of your penis. you can also try covering the device in lubricant to assist. talk to your doctor before using eddie. we recommend trying eddie alone, first, before trying it with a partner, to become familiar with how it feels and works."
